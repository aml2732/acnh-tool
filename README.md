# Development:
- `cd acnh-tool`
- `npm start`

# Data Generation:
If you need to regenerate the data follow the instructions below:
- To generate data you must go to the Fan maintained source: https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet
- In google doc, click the 'Recipes' tab (You might have to arrow over for a bit to find it)
- Then in google doc go to file>download>.csv
- Save/move that file into acnh-tool/data with the file name `Recipes.csv`
- Then run this script: `node scripts/generate-data.js`
- The data will output to acnh-tool/data.json
- Copy this javascript array into recipeList.js

Note this isn't automatically included in the project cus copying all that data and putting on my github in its raw form just doesn't seem right.

# Create dist
- `npm run build`
- Note: you can see your built output in `build` folder, but for demo purposes, a copy is placed in `demo`.
- Note Note: Copying and pasting isn't enough for ^ above step. You need to replace `/static/` with `./static` in index.html (`npm run build` builds with you having a static server in mind. You need to change it to run localy to use relative paths)






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
